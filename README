This is the Java client library and sample code for the Social Sign-In (SSI) service, by Sumilux

This is test line #1

We use Maven as our build tool. 

1. Compile and install our SDK: cd "ssi-sdk", run "mvn install"

2. Our sample assumes the server can be accessed by the browser at 127.0.0.1 (we have a DNS name for it: localhost.sumilux.com). If that is not the case edit "ssi-sdk-sample/src/main/webapp/index.jsp", replace "localhost.sumilux.com" with whatever host name your browser can reach the server at. 

3. Run the "ssi-sdk-sample" app, first "cd ssi-sdk-sample", then issue this simple command: mvn jetty:run

4. Point your browser to http://localhost.sumilux.com:8090

That's all, give it a try...
